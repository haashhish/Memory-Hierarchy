# Memory-Hierarchy

Project is a memory cache simulator that traces the behaviour of the memory cache given
the the cache information including: memory cache size (S), line size (L), and number of
cycles to access memory (clk)
● Input is divided into 2 text files:
○ First one is: “input.txt” which includes: memory cache size (S), line size (L), and
number of cycles to access memory (clk)
○ Second one is: “Memory Addresses.txt” for user to input sequence of 20 memory
addresses in bytes
● The program traces and stores no. of accesses and no. of hits/misses, it displays the cache
index alongside the valid bit and tag for each index. The hit/miss ratio is calculated as
well as Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) value using the value of 100 clock cycles
provided in the project description.
